INTERFACE
-here will be the various overlays and things that appear on the screen during gameplay.


BURGER_FADE_TRANSITION
-goes from right to left when switching from main to minigame.
-------------------------------------------------------------

READY_GO
-appears at the start of each minigame and maybe when returning to main game.

ORDER: 00>>01 etc.

NOTES: the timing for the frames will be finicky, I'll set it up when I remember how to edit things in cloud9.

-------------------------------------------------------------

FINISH
-appears at the end of each minigame and main game stage.

ORDER: 00>>01 etc.

NOTES: the timing for this one may need some tweaking too, as with READY_GO.

-------------------------------------------------------------

RANK_UP_JUMP
-we might use this for the rank up in Main game. action should be paused or slowed when this triggers?

ORDER: 00>>01 etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------

SPIN_POSE
-this may be an alternate idea for rank up, or maybe a different thing entirely?

ORDER: 00>>01 etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------

RANK_UP_TEXT
-plays when rank up happens.

ORDER: 00>>01 etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------

RANK_DOWN_TEXT
-plays when rank down happens.
